Introduction:
-------------
PHP iCalendar is a PHP-based iCal file parser to display iCals in a Web browser. 
Its based on v2.0 of the IETF spec. It displays iCal files in a nice logical, 
clean manner with day, week, and month navigation.

Contact:
--------
E-mail the developers and others on the list at:
phpicalendar-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

Installation:
-------------
- Put PHP iCalendar into your Sites folder (or another web directory)
- Edit the file "config.inc.php" and see section below called "Configuration"
- Put your iCal files into the directory you specify in config.inc.php
  (default is "calendars")
- Make sure PHP is enabled (http://developer.apple.com/internet/macosx/php.html)
- Turn on Web sharing (if not already on)
- View calendars in your web browser
  If it is in your Sites folder, the URL would be:
  <http://localhost/~username/phpicalendar>

Configuration:
--------------
View config.inc.php. The comments behind each variable definition will
tell you what each setting does. Change the values between the quotation
marks to change the setting of that variable. If there are restrictions 
as to what that variable can be set to, the comment behind will specify
them. If you have difficulty with your configuration, you can ask the 
developers and other PHP iCalendar users at the PHP iCalendar forums:
